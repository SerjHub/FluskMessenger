# FluskMessenger
Restful database service for messenger app. Developed with Python3, Flask and MySQL.

This is my first Python project for Restful Databse backend service. It took two months to learn Mysql, Python and Flask 
to launch completed service for registration new users and checking already existing.
Next step will be feature to forward messages between registered users.
